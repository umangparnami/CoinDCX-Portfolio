# CoinDCX Portfolio
An android app made with CoinDCX's API where any CoinDCX user can view their Portfolio and their Profit and Loss for individual currencies.

### Why use this
As there was no **Profit and Loss** feature available in the CoinDCX's app, so like many other users I was
also using **excel sheets** to determine the PnL. But while it did its job, the one thing it didn't have was **realtime price** updation.
So I started working on a personal project using **CoinDCX's API** to build the **Profit and Loss** feature myself.

You can [download](https://github.com/umangparnami/CoinDCX-Portfolio/releases/download/v1.0/CoinDCXPortfolio.apk) the APK and test the features yourself.

### Requirements
To view your portfolio, you just need the **API Key** and **Secret Key**. Paste both of these on the **Settings tab** in the app and you're set.

>Note - If you don't have an **API Key** you can generate one from [here.](https://coindcx.com/api-dashboard)

### Calculate PnL
To view your **Profit and Loss** for all your crypto holdings you just need to enter the **total buy amount** of the crypto you want to calculate PnL for.
This process can't be automated as their is no endpoint to get all the orders in CoinDCX's API.
>**Eg:** You bought Bitcoin in two separate orders, one for **Rs 100** and another for **Rs 200** then enter the total buy amount which is **Rs 300** in the app to calculate PnL for it. If you have any sell orders for that crypto then you should subtract that amount from the total buy.
