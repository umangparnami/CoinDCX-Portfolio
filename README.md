# CoinDCX-Portfolio
An app made with CoinDCX's API where any CoinDCX user can view their Portfolio and their PnL for individual currencies.

# Why I created this
I started this as a personal project, as there was no Profit and Loss feature available in the CoinDCX's app.
So I started developing the app so that other CoinDCX users can also use this feature.
