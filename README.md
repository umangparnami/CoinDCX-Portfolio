# CoinDCX Portfolio
An android app made with CoinDCX's API where any CoinDCX user can view their Portfolio and their Profit and Loss for individual currencies.

### Why use this
As there was no **Profit and Loss** feature available in the CoinDCX's app, so like many other users I was
also using **excel sheets** to determine the PnL. But while it did its job, the one thing it didn't have was **realtime price** updation.
So I started working on a personal project using **CoinDCX's API** to build the **Profit and Loss** feature myself.

You can [download](https://github.com/umangparnami/CoinDCX-Portfolio/releases/download/v1.0/CoinDCX_Portfolio.apk) the APK and test the features yourself.

### Requirements
To view your portfolio, you just need the **API Key** and **Secret Key**. Paste both of these on the **Settings tab** in the app and you're set.

>Note - If you don't have an **API Key** you can generate one from [here.](https://coindcx.com/api-dashboard)
